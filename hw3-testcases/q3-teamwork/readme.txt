The first line has the colors assigned to each robot in order from 0 to N

Every "===" separates the individual test cases for each bot for this color set.
For example, with test case 15:

E B C D A
indicates that the assignment of colors to robots for this test case is
0 gets E
1 gets B
2 gets C
3 gets D
4 gets A

and following that line is === indicating the first test case
5 0 
A B C D E
B C D A

The answer (as given by the first line) is E, 

For each test, at least one of the robots should output the correct answer.
So if robot 0, 1, 2, and 3 output the wrong answer, but 4 gets the right answer, 
the test case passes.
